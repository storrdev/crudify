Removed deletedBefore & deletedAfter query params for the list handler since sequelize does not support that kind of query.

Finished writing list-handler.test.js

Started writing create-handler.test.js

It doesn't look like create-handler has everything necessary to be feature complete. Thinking about skipping
over adding those so I can get to work on springus api v2

Added testing to crudify, setup the docker for a test database, wrote a simple test for createCrudRoutes,
and started on the listHandler() test in tests/handlers/list-handler.test.js. I think I will need
to test it with supertest/superagent like in springus-api-v2.

Just finished testing for list-handler.test.js
