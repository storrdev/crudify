Removed deletedBefore & deletedAfter query params for the list handler since sequelize does not support that kind of query.

Added testing to crudify, setup the docker for a test database, wrote a simple test for createCrudRoutes,
and started on the listHandler() test in tests/handlers/list-handler.test.js. I think I will need
to test it with supertest/superagent like in springus-api-v2.

Just finished testing for list-handler.test.js
